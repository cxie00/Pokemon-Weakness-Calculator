<h1> Pokemon-Weakness-Calculator-Web </h1>


<p>A Pokemon Weakness Calculator with PokeAPI, Flask, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS.</p>
<br>
<h1> Access </h1>

<p>It's finally live on Heroku! You can check it out <a href = "https://pokemonweaknesscalc.herokuapp.com/weakness"> here: https://pokemonweaknesscalc.herokuapp.com/ </a> </p>
<p> The final version includes color-coded types and searching by ID or name. I made this so that my Mom would have an easier time figuring out what to use in Pokemon Go during raid battles. This is my first time pushing a toy project live, and it feels quite slow compared to when I was running it locally. I'll look into that some time, but I'm happy with this full-stack experience. </p>
